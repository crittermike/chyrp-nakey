Nakey for Chyrp
================

Nakey is an ultra-minimal theme for [Chyrp](http://chyrp.net) which is customized for [mikethecoder.com](http://mikethecoder.com).

What's this doing here?
-------------------------

This probably won't be useful for your own site except as an example of customizing individual types of feathers or aggregates.

But I have a question!

If you have any questions about the theme, feel free to [email me directly](mailto:mike@mikethecoder.com).
